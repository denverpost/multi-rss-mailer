# Multi RSS Mailer
Manage multiple RSS-to-email subscriptions and deliveries.

We want to be able to email new items in any number of RSS / Atom feeds to any number of email subscribers.

To do this we need:

1. A list of feeds.
2. A list of email subscribers to each feed.
3. The last time we checked each feed for new items.

This code will manage the list of feeds and the last time each feed was checked, it will not manage the list of email subscribers.
